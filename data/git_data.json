      "ConsolidatedText_Explore": "**Context**\nThe daily mean temperature indicator provides information on long-term climate variability and change. Temperature plays a fundamental role in agricultural productivity, biodiversity and public health.\n\n**Definition**\nThe daily mean air temperature (°C) is representative of the temperature at a height of 2m above the surface. \n\n**Data Sources**\nThe monthly average of daily mean temperature is calculated from an ensemble of five global climate model (GCM) simulations for two CMIP5 scenario projections: RCP2.6 (with low greenhouse gas emissions) and RCP8.5 (with high greenhouse gas emissions). Monthly climate anomalies are calculated relative to a (1981–2010) ERA5 reference period.\n\n**Understand**\nA positive anomaly indicates a warmer temperature than the reference period while a negative anomaly indicates a cooler temperature than the reference period.\n\n**Supporting Information**\nThe data was collated on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).  Further information about this indicator can be found in the C3S documentation resources in the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-agroclimatic-indicators?tab=overview).\n\n***\n\n**Visualisation and Navigation**\nThe daily mean temperature anomaly statistics for the chosen scenario and time period are plotted as area means for each European NUTS region. The EUROSTAT NUTS classification ([Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/background)) is a hierarchical system for dividing up the economic territory of Europe. The size of the regions shown on the map can be adjusted by selecting the appropriate NUTS level; NUTS-0: Countries, NUTS-1: major socio-economic regions, NUTS-2: basic regions, and NUTS-3: small regions.\n\nThe map of NUTS regions facilitates dynamic access to the underlying data. Hover the mouse pointer over a region to view the value of the area mean or click on a region to request a time series plot.\n\nThe time series plot shows the ensemble mean and range of the temperature responses to the chosen scenario conditions across an ensemble of five CMIP5 climate models. Click and hover the mouse over the time series plot to view the data values and to reveal action buttons for features such as “zoom” and “download plot as a png”.\n\nThis indicator is expressed as an anomaly from a reference period so the (1981-2010) ERA5 reference climatology is also provided. The reference climate contains the mean climatology, the standard deviation from the mean, and the 5th and 95th percentiles."

The apparent temperature is a measure of relative discomfort due to combined heat and high humidity.\n\n**Data Sources**\nThe health-related heatwave statistics are calculated using bias-adjusted EURO-CORDEX data for two CMIP5 scenarios with different possible future greenhouse gas emissions: RCP4.5 (medium emissions) and RCP8.5 (high emissions).
